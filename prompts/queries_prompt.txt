You will be given a question and you need to generate a list of queries that will be used to retrieve documents from a vector database.

## Key Guidelines

- The queries should be specific and to the point and should cover all the important aspects of the question.

```json
{{ "queries": ["capital of France", "France capital", "Paris", "French geography", "France"] }}
```
